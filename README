Some monkey patches to get this old legacy project code somewhat working on latest Haxe 3.4 (or 3.3) /OpenFL/Lime/etc, and also with the latest git dev version of Haxepunk (>=4.0).

Should be working on all platforms except Flash. (Haxepunk dropped support for Flash from version >=4).

Haxepunk GUI is outdated and not compatible with the latest Haxepunk 4, and HaxePunk 4 no longer supports Canvas class, so, some of the UIs and visuals would been left out due to outdated incompatible code. I just needed this project to run, that's all.

`haxelib git HaxePunk https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git dev`

Various experiments on making a dungeon crawling game with haXe.
Nothing really worthy, just learning HaXe and implementing roguelike-related
algorithms in haXe. I'm also using and testing Ash entity-component framework
that I have ported from ActionScript 3 (see https://github.com/nadako/Ash-HaXe).
